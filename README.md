# CryptoClustering
- Predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using unsupervised learning: K-Means clustering and PCA, specifically

- Dataset
The dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC.

- Approach
Prepare the data.

Use StandardScaler() to normalise the data.
Create a DataFrame with the scaled data, with the crypto name as the index.
Find the best value for k using the original data.

Use the helper function elbow_curve() to plot the curve.
Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original data.

Create a scatter plot and assign to a variable
Optimise clusters with Principal Component Analysis.

Create a PCA model with 3 principal components.
Calculate the total and explained variance.
Create a DataFrame with the calculated PC values.
Find the best value for k using the PCA data: As with Step 2.

Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data: As with Step 3.

- Visualise and compare the results.
Create a composite plot of the elbow curves using the (+) operator.
Create a composite plot to contrast the clusters using the (+) operator.
